# Calories-Burnt-Predictor
<p>The overarching idea of this research project
is to make a comparative study of machine learning
algorithms to predict the calories burn during the
workout. In this paper we first build a machine learning
systems that can predict the amount of calories burnt
during exercise. In todayâ€™s world many people are
inquisitive about the workout that they do and the
weight loss plan that they take and how much calorie do
they burn once they workout. To solve this problem we
can use ML alggoirthms such as XGBoost regressor and
Linear Regression.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>he body temperature and the heartbeat will rise when we
exercise or workout. The variables that we take here such as
time scale for which the individual carrying out the workout
training and what is the average beats per minute and then
the temperature. Then we additionally take the height,
weight, gender and age of the person to predict how tons
energy the person may be burning.
A machine learning XGBoost regressor algorithm and linear
regression algorithms are used to predict calories burned
depends on the workout duration,body temperature,
height,weight and age of the person.
