# Calories-Burnt-Predictor
<p>The overarching idea of this research project
is to make a comparative study of machine learning
algorithms to predict the calories burn during the
workout. In this paper we first build a machine learning
systems that can predict the amount of calories burnt
during exercise. In todayâ€™s world many people are
inquisitive about the workout that they do and the
weight loss plan that they take and how much calorie do
they burn once they workout. To solve this problem we
can use ML alggoirthms such as XGBoost regressor and
Linear Regression.</p>
