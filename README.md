# Calories-Burnt-Predictor
<p>The overarching idea of this research project
is to make a comparative study of machine learning
algorithms to predict the calories burn during the
workout. In this paper we first build a machine learning
systems that can predict the amount of calories burnt
during exercise. In todayâ€™s world many people are
inquisitive about the workout that they do and the
weight loss plan that they take and how much calorie do
they burn once they workout. To solve this problem we
can use ML alggoirthms such as XGBoost regressor and
Linear Regression.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>he body temperature and the heartbeat will rise when we
exercise or workout. The variables that we take here such as
time scale for which the individual carrying out the workout
training and what is the average beats per minute and then
the temperature. Then we additionally take the height,
weight, gender and age of the person to predict how tons
energy the person may be burning.
A machine learning XGBoost regressor algorithm and linear
regression algorithms are used to predict calories burned
depends on the workout duration,body temperature,
height,weight and age of the person.

<h2>Methodology</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Document your code that supports mathematical
      equations</li>
 <li> Create,Upload,Share notebooks</li>
 <li>Import and save notebook from or to Google Drive</li>
 <li>Import or Publish notebooks from GitHub</li>
 <li>Import external datasets e.g. from Kaggle</li>
 <li>Integrate PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV</li>
 <li>Free Cloud service with free</li>
  </ul
<h2>cONCLUSION</h2>
<p>From the analysis we met with a conclusion that the XGB
Regressor has more accurate results than the Linear regression
model. Mean absolute error imply absolute error ought to be
as low as viable.. it is not anything but the difference between
the actual and predicted values through the models. The mean
absolute error value that is getting in XGB Regressor is 2.71
which is a good value.The error values is very less. Therefore
we can conclude that the best model for the calorie burn
prediction is XGBoost Regressor.
